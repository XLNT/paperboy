# ðŸ“° Paperboy

> Paperboy is a replacement for web3's subscriptions/filters. It uses the output of @xlnt/gnarly-reducer-events which means it's highly reliable, resilient to downtime, single-delivery (best effort), etc.

**Basically, it'll solve your event watching problems.**

## Usage

To use paperboy, first start a [gnarly](https://github.com/XLNT/gnarly) instance that's configured with the **@xlnt/gnarly-reducer-events** reducer. Then simply point paperboy at the output of this reducer and have yourself a good time.

ðŸ›  Better docs are incoming, as well as a docker container, etc.

But until then, you can play around with paperboy by

```bash
# install deps
yarn install

# optionally use default environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# run the app
yarn run ts-start
```

Then connect to the endpoint at port `:3000` using a websocket and issue a filter request.
